# RGB Color Game
A simple JavaScript game that tests your knowledge of RGB color values.

It is based on an exercise in Colt Steele's ["The Web Developer Bootcamp"](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) course on Udemy.

## How It Works
* There are three difficulty levels: **easy**, **medium**, and **hard**.
	* The **easy** mode has three colors to choose from
	* The **medium** mode has six colors to choose from
	* the **hard** mode has nine colors to choose from
* The RGB value in the title is the color that you are trying to identify. 
* Click on the square with the corresponding color to "guess".
* A "Try Again" message will appear if you have chosen the incorrect square.
* "New Colors" refreshes the displayed RGB value and displays a new assortment of colored squares.
